# Adversarial-Robustness-Evaluation-of-a-Deep-Face-Recognition-System
Evaluated the robustness of a deep face recognition model (InceptionResNetV1) against adversarial attacks. Tested multiple attack types, analyzed transferability, and implemented a defense system using specialized detectors to improve security while preserving accuracy
